I got given a task to make a functional clone website of The World's 1st Meat-Free Lifestyle Platform KindMeal.my. KindMeal.my is a Malaysia startup Founded by Andy K oh in 2008, PetFinder.my has been working hard with nationwide animal shelters, rescuers, and pet lovers to improve Malaysia's animal welfare. Much of our focus was centered upon pets - specifically, dogs and cats (alright, we have rabbits, hamsters, birds, fishes, turtles-, and chickens too). The website some pages such as Login, signup, Landing-page, Meal Deals, Help, etc.
I tried my best to clone the website from scratch based on the knowledge gained till unit-4 of Journey at Masai School.
