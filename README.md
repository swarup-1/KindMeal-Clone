Hello everyone, this is a Readme for my construct week project that has been completed successfully within the duration of 5 days. It was really greate experience for me. Below I have described the Features of my project.


## The Journey:

The Journey so far has been challenging and fun. this was my second individual project and the deadline was just a week, it all felt like I was working on a real product, and also I tried to enact the overall activity as the real working climate where I used git commands & React project Structure. The planning and other doubt solving activities with IA were done via zoom meetings.

## Project Details:

I got given a task to make a functional clone website of The World's 1st Meat-Free Lifestyle Platform KindMeal.my. KindMeal.my is a Malaysia startup Founded by Andy K oh in 2008, PetFinder.my has been working hard with nationwide animal shelters, rescuers, and pet lovers to improve Malaysia's animal welfare. Much of our focus was centered upon pets - specifically, dogs and cats (alright, we have rabbits, hamsters, birds, fishes, turtles-, and chickens too). The website some pages such as Login, signup, Landing-page, Meal Deals, Help, etc.
I tried my best to clone the website from scratch based on the knowledge gained till unit-4 of Journey at Masai School.
